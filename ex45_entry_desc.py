		familiar enough with the neighborhood to know

		that really is it. The kitchen and bathroom have 
		well-scarred linoleum, all other floors have 
		blue carpet that reminds you of hospitals and 
		churches. When you get to the back bedroom you 
		see the dumpsters across the two car parking 
		lot. It's dark back there and private. Bars 
		cover the window. You return to the leasing
