                The leasing agent is a small, professionally
		dressed woman who seems to be trying to be 
		patient as you look the place over. 7pm and
		was the earliest she could meet you and dusk 
		forces you to use the ceiling lights in the 
		kitchen and bathroom; frosted glass domes 
		dotted inside with bug carcasses. You're 
		familiar enough with the neighborhood to know
		that you'll have plenty to do nearby. A 
		living-room, kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms, 
		that really is it. The kitchen and bathroom have 
		well-scarred linoleum, all other floors have 
		blue carpet that reminds you of hospitals and 
		churches. When you get to the back bedroom you 
		see the dumpsters across the two car parking 
		lot. It's dark back there and private. Bars 
		cover the window. You return to the leasing
		agent.

	 arrived at. The agent leads you down the outer basement 
	 steps and inside. The good points are the richly colored
